# Time-Series-Forecasting 

### Project Objectives: 
This project aims to develop a scalable and efficient system for forecasting store-level sales for individual items using Prophet and PySpark. The system will provide insights into future demand, which allows for better overall business planning. 

### Project Summary: 
This project uses Facebook's Prophet library to build individual sales forecasting models for each combination of 5 stores and 50 items over a 5-year period historical dataset. 
PySpark is leveraged to handle the large data volume and to faciliate parallel model training for enhanced efficiency.
